## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Python project:

1. Set Up Virtual Environment
   - Install `virtualenv` if it's not already installed:
     ```
     pip3 install virtualenv
     ```
   - Create a new virtual environment:
     ```
     virtualenv env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```
       source env/bin/activate
       ```
     - On Windows:
       ```
       .\env\Scripts\activate
       ```

2. Install Dependencies
   - Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Run the Project
   - Run the Python project using Flask's built-in development server:
     ```
     flask run
     ```

   After running the command, Flask will start the development server, and you should see the URL where you can access the application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to adjust the instructions according to your specific project structure and requirements.
- If you encounter any issues during installation or running the application, refer to the project's documentation or troubleshooting section for assistance.
- For production deployment, consider using a more robust server setup, such as Gunicorn or uWSGI, instead of the Flask development server.
